# PDP-8/X
## A design for a new implementation of a PDP-8

The end goal of this project is to actually build one in real hardware

### Simulation requirements
I'm using Helmut Neemans 'Digital' for the simulation. It is required to use a pre-release version of software - v0.23-065 or higher. The standard v0.23 release lacks octal setttings that I use.

The prereleases are available from https://infdigital.dhbw-mosbach.de

The main repo of the Digital project is at https://github.com/hneemann/Digital
