# Interrupt test softwares

These three test routines was written by Vince Slyngstad back in the early
2000 to help Henk debug his 6809-based PDP-8 emulator.

I also had some problems with the implementation of the interrupts and
wanted to be able to test my implementation with code that was written
by someone else than myself.  So I asked Vince if he still had the code, 
and he was able to dig them up after all these years. Nice!

- intIO - Interrupt-based input and output
- intout - Interrupt-based input and print "HELLO"
- tstest - Check for existence of the timeshare option

Vince have graciously allowed me to publish the code here in this repo.
